  # Whenever you add a new query or mutation to `schema.graphql` and run `make graphql`, a file will generate named "resolver_DELETE.go".
  # Go into that file and copy and paste the new query/mutation method you just created in `schema.graphql` and put it in a separate file 
  # under the resolvers package (or add it to an existing file if its within scope). Afterwards, you can delete resolver_DELETE.go to get 
  # rid of the errors.
